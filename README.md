"# Express-Basics"
This repository is about the fundamentals of ExpressJs.
I used postman to make requests and see the output.

##
If you are interested and want to know whats inside
Just run this command in terminal;
### This will download express and nodemon.
npm install
##
Nodemon is a utility that will monitor for any changes in your source and automatically restart your server.
##
after that run this;
###
npm run dev
